# ETLNetflixProject

For the ETL project, chose to use the “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” and “IMDb movies” data sets from the Kaggle.com. Selected these datasets as the information detailed in these files have similar categories and will allow for more seamless integration when merging the files. In this report, will articulate the processes used to clean and upload these files into a relational database.
